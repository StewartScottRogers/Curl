# Curl.Engine.UnitLibrary

The managed transfer engine (ADR-0506): the code that runs a transfer, moving out of
`Curl.Console` so that `Curl.Console`, `Curl.Api` and `Libcurl` can all drive it. Namespace
`Curl.Engine`. Empty of transfer code until the engine moves (BL-2285 onwards).

It references `Curl.Cli.UnitLibrary` only temporarily; BL-2310 drops that reference.

Never reference `Curl.Console`, `Libcurl` or `Curl.Api`: the engine sits beneath all three.

Held to the four quality gates in the root `CLAUDE.md`. Its tests live in `Curl.Engine.UnitTests`.
