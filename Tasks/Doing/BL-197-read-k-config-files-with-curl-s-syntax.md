# BL-197 — Read -K/--config files with curl's syntax

## Goal

`-K`/`--config` files are read through an injected reader and their options applied as if given on the command line.

## Context

- Filed from the Phase 1 HTTP plan (protocol-architect, 2026-09-26), item C11. Upstream references: https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html and https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html; behaviour measured on curl 8.21.0.
- Syntax: https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-K (curl 8.21.0).
- Where a criterion says *measured*, run curl 8.21.0 - the mingw build `/mingw64/bin/curl`, first on PATH, which is the Windows reference (ADR-0009 and the BL-153 ADR) - against a loopback server (the BL-165 recording script `Record-CurlExchange.ps1` once it exists), record the exact command and the bytes it produced in `Notes`, then pin them in a test. Never pin text that was not measured.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Quoting, escapes, `=`/`:`/space separators, `#` comments, `url = ...` and nested `-K` behave as measured on curl 8.21.0; a test per rule.
- [ ] An unreadable file and a malformed line give the measured lines and exit.
- [ ] Every refusal and warning this option group can raise exits 2 with the exact lines measured on curl 8.21.0, and every `--no-` spelling curl accepts for these options is measured and tested (a test per spelling).
- [ ] `dotnet build Curl.Cli.UnitLibrary -warnaserror` is clean; `dotnet test --filter "TestCategory!=Integration"` passes and no new test needs `TestCategory=Integration`; `Measure-CodeQuality.ps1` reports 100% line and branch coverage and no failing member for `Curl.Cli`.

## Notes

- Plan item: C11 in the Phase 1 HTTP plan (2026-09-26); plan keys in this file were replaced by their task IDs.
