# BL-2530 — Port libtest programs 539 to 553 to C# and add their cases to the ratchet

## Goal

The libtest programs numbered 539 to 553 (batch 4) are ported to C# and every upstream case that runs them and passes is on the ratchet.

## Context

Phase 5 of `Documentation/Planning/Curl-Api-And-libcurl.md` and ADR-0506. Upstream curl 8.22.0 ships its libtest programs as C in the tarball's `tests/libtest`; the vendored `Curl.Conformance.UnitTests/UpstreamTestData` holds only the case files. A case runs a program through its `<client><tool>` line (`lib%TESTNUMBER` or `libNNN`); 259 distinct programs serve 364 cases (the plan's "362 programs" counted source files). The ports are C# `ILibTest` classes in `Curl.Conformance.LibTest.UnitLibrary`, written over `Libcurl`, with tests in `Curl.Conformance.LibTest.UnitTests`. Batch 4 of 26: programs 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 547, 549, 552, 553. Read each program's C source in the tarball, its case file under `UpstreamTestData` and the helpers from the harness tasks; add a helper to the harness library when two ports need it, with its own test. Where a program needs a Libcurl feature that is missing, file an engine or Libcurl task and add it to this task's `depends-on`, moving the task to Backlog, in the first turns.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Each of lib539, lib540, lib541, lib542, lib543, lib544, lib547, lib549, lib552, lib553 (those that exist in tests/libtest; a number whose case uses another tool is noted under Notes) is a C# `ILibTest` in `Curl.Conformance.LibTest.UnitLibrary` registered in the runner's table, with a focused unit test in `Curl.Conformance.LibTest.UnitTests` that drives it over a fake `ICurlEngine`.
- [ ] Every upstream case that runs one of these programs, and passes through the runner on Windows, is added to `Curl.Conformance.UnitTests/PassingUpstreamCases.txt`; a case that fails is left off and filed as a task with the board script (its test number and the differing lines), not repaired here beyond the port.
- [ ] No added case's output depends on the platform (path separators, drive letters, OS error text, certificates); one that does is pinned per platform or left off.
- [ ] `Measure-CodeQuality.ps1 -Library Curl.Conformance.LibTest.UnitLibrary` reports 0 failing members (100% line and branch coverage, complexity at most 10, CRAP at most 30).
- [ ] `dotnet build` is clean and the fast tests pass with no test deleted, skipped or weakened.
- [ ] `Curl.Conformance.UnitTests/PassingUpstreamCases.txt` is unchanged or grown, and every case it lists still passes.
