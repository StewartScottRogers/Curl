# BL-1622 — Make the Curl.Protocol.Ssh.UnitTests SshUserAuthenticationTests write descriptive diagnostic output

## Goal

Every test in these files of `Curl.Protocol.Ssh.UnitTests` writes, through BL-1457's shared `TestDiagnostics` helper, the Arrange inputs that matter, its Act result and its assertion context (expected against actual, first differing byte or character), plus `PHASE` timings where it has distinct phases; no test's logic or assertions change. Files: Authentication/SshUserAuthenticationTests.cs and its partials (.Agent, .KeyFileCertificate, .PublicKey, .RsaCertificate, .VerboseLines, .WinCngKeyTypes) (about 103 test methods, counted 2026-10-07).

## Context

- Split from BL-1484: one task for the whole project (811 test methods in 94 files) was too big for one `/task-run`. BL-1484's Context applies in full: the line format and helper usage in `Documentation/Wiki/Test-Diagnostics.md` and BL-1457's ADR; what matters for SSH (packets as `BYTES` with their decoded message number, negotiated algorithms, keys as hex, authentication steps, SFTP and SCP requests and replies, `PHASE` lines); output only; `BYTES` for large payloads; nothing OS-dependent. BL-1481 (`Curl.Protocol.Rtsp.UnitTests/RtspDiagnostics.cs`) is a worked example.
- A shared helper in this project (for example `SshDiagnostics.cs`) may be added or extended by whichever split task gets there first; the others reuse it.
- Classes: SshUserAuthenticationTests.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `dotnet test Curl.Protocol.Ssh.UnitTests --filter "TestCategory!=Integration&(FullyQualifiedName~<class>|...)" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"` over this task's classes prints an `END` line for every test it runs, and piping that output to `Select-String -Pattern 'END .*(\(arrange 0,|, act 0,|, assert 0\))'` prints nothing.
- [ ] The filtered run's test count is unchanged, and in this task's files the numbers of `Assert.`, `[TestMethod` and `[DataRow(` matches (`Select-String -AllMatches`) are no lower than before; before and after numbers are recorded in Notes.
- [ ] `dotnet build Curl.Protocol.Ssh.UnitTests -warnaserror` is clean and `dotnet test Curl.Protocol.Ssh.UnitTests --filter "TestCategory!=Integration"` passes.
- [ ] The task's commits change only files under `Curl.Protocol.Ssh.UnitTests/` and this task file.
- [ ] Notes list every test that printed a `SLOW:` line with its `PHASE` breakdown, or say none did; a real performance problem gets a follow-up task whose ID is in Notes.
