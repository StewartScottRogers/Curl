# BL-4349 — Fix CI failure job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP on Windows

## Goal

`job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP` passes on Windows, Linux and macOS, so the `CI` workflow on the shift's branch is green again.

## Context

Filed by the dark factory's CI watch (BL-987). `job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP` failed on Windows in CI run 41071219626 (https://github.com/StewartScottRogers/Curl/actions/runs/41071219626). First failing commit: 302d7dd3.

    [36;1m  Write-Host "::error file=$($m.file.Replace('\', '/')),line=$($m.line)::$($m.member) is outside a gate: $($m.fails -join ', ')"[0m; ExtensionCommandLineOptions.Checked(System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<Curl.Extension.Abstractions.ExtensionOption>, System.Func<string, bool>) is outside a gate: complexity

Lanes test only on Windows, so reproduce with `gh run view 41071219626 --log-failed` and fix it platform-neutrally (CLAUDE.md, "Tests pass on Windows, Linux and macOS").

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP` passes locally, and the `CI` workflow passes on Windows, Linux and macOS for the commit that lands the fix.
