# BL-2269 — Fix CI failure job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP on Windows

## Goal

`job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP` passes on Windows, Linux and macOS, so the `CI` workflow on the shift's branch is green again.

## Context

Filed by the dark factory's CI watch (BL-987). `job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP` failed on Windows in CI run 38700283564 (https://github.com/StewartScottRogers/Curl/actions/runs/38700283564). First failing commit: 639a0aec.

    [36;1mforeach ($m in @((Get-Content "$env:RUNNER_TEMP\coverage.json" -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json).failing)) {[0m

Lanes test only on Windows, so reproduce with `gh run view 38700283564 --log-failed` and fix it platform-neutrally (CLAUDE.md, "Tests pass on Windows, Linux and macOS").

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `job Quality gates (windows-latest) step Measure coverage, complexity and CRAP` passes locally, and the `CI` workflow passes on Windows, Linux and macOS for the commit that lands the fix.
