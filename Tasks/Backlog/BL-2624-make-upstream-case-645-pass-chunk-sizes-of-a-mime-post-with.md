# BL-2624 — Make upstream case 645 pass: chunk sizes of a MIME post with unknown-size callback parts

## Goal

Upstream case 645 (lib643 with unknown-size callback parts, sent chunked) passes through the runner.

## Context

Found by BL-2534; the ports in `Curl.Conformance.LibTest.UnitLibrary` are unit tested and follow their C sources. Differences: 645 `<verify><protocol> differs at byte 182 (line 8): expected "7c\r\n", got "7b\r\n"` (the first chunk is one byte short; case 643, the same program with sizes known, passes). Run each with `CURL_UPSTREAM_CASE=<n>` and the manual test `NamedUpstreamCase_RunThroughCurl_PassesAsAListedCaseMust`; in the first pass find the engine or Libcurl project at fault and add it to `touches` before any edit.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Each named case that passes through the runner on Windows is added to `Curl.Conformance.UnitTests/PassingUpstreamCases.txt`; one that still fails is filed with the board script with its differing lines.
- [ ] Any product fix has a focused unit test in the fixed library's own `.UnitTests` project (ADR-0482).
- [ ] No added case's output depends on the platform.
- [ ] `dotnet build` is clean and the fast tests pass with no test deleted, skipped or weakened.
